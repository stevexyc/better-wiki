so this can be done using components 

everything is an item. every item has its own html. 

when editing one is able to edit everything. 

When displaying an item, the software actually searches through its text and matches its text with other items. This is usually how other programs does this right?


also, please avoid the infinite loop while auto matching, thanks.
