so this can be done using components 

everything is an item. every item has its own html. 

when editing one is able to edit everything. 

When displaying an item, the software actually searches through its text and matches its text with other items. This is usually how other programs does this right?


also, please avoid the infinite loop while auto matching, thanks. 


I totally gave up on auto matching.... instead i am using links within medium editor now... so you have to manually set up a link and what it points to. I should really create slugs and shit to make sure term names are not retarded lol.
