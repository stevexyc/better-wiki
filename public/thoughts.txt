so what should i do now? what is the ultimate vision for this app? well I want to set it up as kind of a generalq style app. except better of course lol. Anyways, i wish to create a website where people all over can create their own wiki system. 

- well this must mean that there is a user registration system, which can be done. There must also be a purchasing system, (bitcoin)?
- maybe not focus on all the features available, but instead on the fact that this is a minimal viable product. Like... really fucking minimal.
- well this isnt so bad... things work... its not bad... i would ideally like a way to write custom code, just for my sanity, but hey, the point of this is simplicity right?
- what if i added back in the fucking image thingy?
